#Introduction
Before diving into "loops", make the console output with the words: "writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and
it's also time-consuming" for 20 times.

###Plain task solution
You must have got something like this:

    System.out.println("writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and it's also time consuming");
    System.out.println("writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and it's also time consuming");
    System.out.println("writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and it's also time consuming");
    System.out.println("writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and it's also time consuming");
    System.out.println("writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and it's also time consuming");
    System.out.println("writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and it's also time consuming");
    System.out.println("writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and it's also time consuming");
    System.out.println("writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and it's also time consuming");
    System.out.println("writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and it's also time consuming");
    System.out.println("writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and it's also time consuming");
    System.out.println("writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and it's also time consuming");
    System.out.println("writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and it's also time consuming");
    System.out.println("writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and it's also time consuming");
    System.out.println("writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and it's also time consuming");
    System.out.println("writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and it's also time consuming");
    System.out.println("writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and it's also time consuming");
    System.out.println("writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and it's also time consuming");
    System.out.println("writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and it's also time consuming");
    System.out.println("writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and it's also time consuming");
    System.out.println("writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and it's also time consuming");
    System.out.println("writing the same code doesn't have much impact, and it's also time consuming");

There's something wrong with that code, isn't it? Imagine that you were to make this action not for 20 times, but
for a hundred, a thousand... a million. That would take eternity to do that with almost no impact, and what is more 
that code will become unreadable. 

# The most basic loops


As you can see the action is the same no matter how many times we use that, and that particular action can be used
